Juggler Proof-of-Work
=======================

**THIS CODE IS EXPERIMENTAL AND SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR ANYTHING.**

Juggler is a proof-of-work puzzle system that requires lots of computing time
*and memory* to solve, but very little memory to verify.

Unfortunately, it *does* require lots of computing time to verify, but it is
a simpler operation, so it is still faster to check than it is to solve. It may
be possible to remove this computational requirement on the verifier by using
fancy crypto voodoo; I don't know yet.

If you want to know how it works, look at the code. Sorry I'm tired and would
rather sleep than write up an English explanation right now.
